# SOSsignal
Use Arduino to create an SOS signal on an external LED

The current code has the LED connected to digital pin 12.
The Arduino has a built in 5V power source that can be used for this circuit.
A resistor (I used 220 ohms) is connected to digital pin 12.
The resistor is then followed in series by the positive lead of the LED.
The negative lead of the LED is connected to the GND pin.

A video of it working and the circuit can be viewed at the following link;
